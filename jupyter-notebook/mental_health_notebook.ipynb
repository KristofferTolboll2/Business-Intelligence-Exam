We could also encode features like `country_live` `country_work`, since they are also categorical features. But one using our encoding technique `one hot encoding` it will introduce some issues as described below\n",

    "The main purpose of labelling is to transform our categorical or text based features into a data format, that our machine learning models can easily understand. We will use the `sklearn` library for this, which has many many encoding techniques, i will chose to focus on two different approaches:\n",

    "This technique is fairly simple and it just converts each possible category to an incrementing float. A demenonstration is given below, where we take all the categorical columns, and convert them using the label_encoder. This however introduces a new problem (as stated previously). Our model might assume, that we have some kind of hierarchy or order in our data. Here we can use `one hot encoding`\n",

    "Like in the example above, we could for example take the sex category (in our example we have already represented each `sex` by a numeric value), and represented each gender by it's own column. For every `female` entry we only put the value (we use to represent a binary value 1 = True, 0 = False), in the `female` column to represent, that the sex is female.\n"

    "After we added the `shuffle=True` parameter, it is now randomly shuffled. This can however still become an issue with larger datasets. The way that the `train_test_split` determinants the split is by a parameter called `random_state`. Behind the scene, this number is splitting our data randomly. The problem will be, that we can not gaurentee, that it will still not overfit. We can be \"unlucky\", and a portion of same data with the same features (same `sex` or same `country` or whatever, can still end up in either test or train), everytime we use some parameter for `random_state` we know, that the data split will always be the same. We HAVE NOT specified `random_state` for the above example, because we want new results everytime\n",
